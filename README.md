### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I would describe myself as a self-taught frontend engineer, with a fond passion for learning everything about Javascript, Typescript, and React.

:octocat: I have a burning desire to build apps, and have a number of ideas, to name a few such as a Pantry app (ok so who doesnt want to build their favourite recipe app), and have some great ideas to start Horizon, a crowd-sourced application to investigate the future.

Iâ€™m currently learning about the serverless landscape :tada:

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NextJS, React, Typescript, GraphQL, HTML, Tailwind and CSS in general.   

ðŸ“« How to reach me: oreillyross at gmail.com
