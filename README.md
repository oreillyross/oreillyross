### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Software engineer, with a passion for lifelong learning. Currently proficient in React, Typescript, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I know python well enough to build Flask apis and moderately complex Machine learning applications using scikit-learn, Pandas, and numpy. 

:octocat: I build apps, and have a number of ideas, to name a few such as a Pantry app (ok so who doesnt want to build their favourite recipe app), and have some great ideas to start Horizon, a crowd-sourced application to investigate the future.

Iâ€™m learning about how to apply machine learning models, mainly supervised learning to automate some of my apps :tada:

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NextJS, React, Typescript, Python, GraphQL, HTML, Tailwind and CSS.
