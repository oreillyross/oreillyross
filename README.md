### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Frontend software engineer, with a passion for lifelong learning. Currently proficient in React, Typescript, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I know python well enough to be dangerous and am currently learning Golang. 

:octocat: I build apps, and have a number of ideas, to name a few such as a Pantry app (ok so who doesnt want to build their favourite recipe app), and have some great ideas to start Horizon, a crowd-sourced application to investigate the future.

Iâ€™m intrigued about serverless and microservices technology :tada:

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about NextJS, React, Typescript, Python, GraphQL, HTML, Tailwind and CSS in general.
